The victor of the battle, the state of Qin, is no different. There, the political parties led by Ying Zheng and Buwei L\u00fc continue their inner conflict. Having played the role of king in the coalition battle, Zheng has the trust of the people\u2014but L\u00fc is far from out of the fight. In 18 months, he plans to interrupt Zheng's coming-of-age ceremony. Meanwhile, a Zhao army numbering 20,000 troops has set out toward Qin. In the royal court, due to the lack of generals capable of responding to the incoming threat, L\u00fc slyly suggests that Zheng take command. However, Cheng Jiao, Zheng's half-brother, volunteers instead. As they grew to trust each other during the coalition battle, Zheng now accepts Jiao as his replacement. However, the Zhao forces retreat a mere half-day after clashing with Jiao's army. With trouble quickly brewing in the shadows, the internal struggle of Qin is only complicated further. There are only two men Zheng feels he can rely on: Bi, a general who commands 30,000 men; and Xin, the leader of the Fei Xin force.

By the year 2071, humanity has expanded across the galaxy, filling the surface of other planets with settlements like those on Earth. These new societies are plagued by murder, drug use, and theft, and intergalactic outlaws are hunted by a growing number of tough bounty hunters. Spike Spiegel and Jet Black pursue criminals throughout space to make a humble living. Beneath his goofy and aloof demeanor, Spike is haunted by the weight of his violent past. Meanwhile, Jet manages his own troubled memories while taking care of Spike and the Bebop, their ship. The duo is joined by the beautiful con artist Faye Valentine, odd child Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky IV, and Ein, a bioengineered Welsh Corgi. While developing bonds and working to catch a colorful cast of criminals, the Bebop crew's lives are disrupted by a menace from Spike's past. As a rival's maniacal plot continues to unravel, Spike must choose between life with his newfound family or revenge for his old wounds. [Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"When Cowboy Bebop first aired in spring of 1998 on TV Tokyo, only episodes 2, 3, 7-15, and 18 were broadcast, it was concluded with a recap special known as Yose Atsume Blues. This was due to anime censorship having increased following the big controversies over Evangelion, as a result most of the series was pulled from the air due to violent content. Satellite channel WOWOW picked up the series in the fall of that year and aired it in its entirety uncensored. Cowboy Bebop was not a ratings hit in Japan, but sold over 19,000 DVD units in the initial release run, and 81,000 overall. Protagonist Spike Spiegel won Best Male Character, and Megumi Hayashibara won Best Voice Actor for her role as Faye Valentine in the 1999 and 2000 Anime Grand Prix, respectively. Cowboy Bebop's biggest influence has been in the United States, where it premiered on Adult Swim in 2001 with many reruns since. The show's heavy Western influence struck a chord with American viewers, where it became a \"gateway drug\" to anime aimed at adult audiences.","season":"spring","year":1998,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"01:00","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 01:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Visual","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/23\/Bandai_Visual"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/102\/Funimation"},{"mal_id":233,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Entertainment","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/233\/Bandai_Entertainment"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Sunrise","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/14\/Sunrise"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/50\/Adult_Cast"},{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"Space","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/29\/Space"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":33095,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/33095\/Shouwa_Genroku_Rakugo_Shinjuu__Sukeroku_Futatabi-hen","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/10\/82947.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/10\/82947t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/10\/82947l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/10\/82947.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/10\/82947t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/10\/82947l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"wxFCi-ybQ5k","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wxFCi-ybQ5k","embed_url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/wxFCi-ybQ5k?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/wxFCi-ybQ5k\/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/wxFCi-ybQ5k\/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/wxFCi-ybQ5k\/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/wxFCi-ybQ5k\/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/wxFCi-ybQ5k\/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"title":"Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu: Sukeroku Futatabi-hen","title_english":"Descending Stories: Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinju","title_japanese":"\u662d\u548c\u5143\u7984\u843d\u8a9e\u5fc3\u4e2d\uff5e\u52a9\u516d\u518d\u3073\u7bc7\uff5e","title_synonyms":["Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu 2nd Season","Showa and Genroku Era Lover's Suicide Through Rakugo 2nd Season"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2017-01-07T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2017-03-25T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":7,"month":1,"year":2017},"to":{"day":25,"month":3,"year":2017}},"string":"Jan 7, 2017 to Mar 25, 2017"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":8.75,"scored_by":59495,"rank":39,"popularity":1154,"members":170679,"favorites":2951,"synopsis":"Even after having risen to the utmost rank of shun'ichi, Yotarou struggles to find his own identity in the world of rakugo.

The travelling Mushishi, Ginko, persists in trying to set right the strange and unsettling situations he encounters. Time loops, living shadows, and telepathy are among the overt effects of interference from Mushi, but more subtle symptoms that take years to be noticed also rouse Ginko's concern as he passes from village to village. Through circumstance, Ginko has become an arbiter, determining which Mushi are blessings and which are curses. But the lines that he seeks to draw are subjective. Some of his patients would rather exercise their new powers until they are utterly consumed by them; others desperately strive to rid themselves of afflictions which are in fact protecting their lives from devastation. Those who cross paths with Mushi must learn to accept seemingly impossible consequences for their actions, and heal wounds they did not know they had. Otherwise, they risk meeting with fates beyond their comprehension.
