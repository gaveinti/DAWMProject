What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal Titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.

Yuuta is saddled with a monstrous curse, a power that dishes out brutal revenge against his bullies. Rika Orimoto, Yuuta's curse, is a shadow from his tragic childhood and a potentially lethal threat to anyone who dares wrong him. Yuuta's unique situation catches the attention of Satoru Gojou, a powerful sorcerer who teaches at Tokyo Jujutsu High.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Samurai Champloo is the only anime to have featured music from the Japanese hip-hop producer Nujabes prior to his death in 2010. The anime also spawned the 2006 video game Samurai Champloo: Sidetracked for the PlayStation 2. The show aired in two parts, with the first half airing Thursdays at 2:28 AM on Fuji TV from May 20, 2004 to September 23, 2004, and the second half airing Saturdays at 10:30 AM on BS Fuji from January 22, 2005 to March 19, 2005. Geneon Entertainment USA originally licensed and released the show in North America, but after their closure in late 2007, the show went out of print. FUNimation Entertainment later entered a distribution deal with Geneon to distribute some of their titles, including Samurai Champloo. After the distribution deal ended, FUNimation later outright licensed the series.","season":"spring","year":2004,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"10:30","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 10:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":123,"type":"anime","name":"Victor Entertainment","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/123\/Victor_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":169,"type":"anime","name":"Fuji TV","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/169\/Fuji_TV"},{"mal_id":271,"type":"anime","name":"Barnum Studio","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/271\/Barnum_Studio"},{"mal_id":382,"type":"anime","name":"Tokuma Shoten","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/382\/Tokuma_Shoten"},{"mal_id":464,"type":"anime","name":"flying DOG","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/464\/flying_DOG"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/102\/Funimation"},{"mal_id":1459,"type":"anime","name":"Geneon Entertainment USA","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1459\/Geneon_Entertainment_USA"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":32,"type":"anime","name":"Manglobe","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/32\/Manglobe"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/13\/Historical"},{"mal_id":21,"type":"anime","name":"Samurai","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/21\/Samurai"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/27\/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":25777,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/25777\/Shingeki_no_Kyojin_Season_2","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/4\/84177.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/4\/84177t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/4\/84177l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/4\/84177.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/4\/84177t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/4\/84177l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"zLaVP8IhIuc","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zLaVP8IhIuc","embed_url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/zLaVP8IhIuc?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/zLaVP8IhIuc\/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/zLaVP8IhIuc\/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/zLaVP8IhIuc\/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/zLaVP8IhIuc\/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/zLaVP8IhIuc\/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"title":"Shingeki no Kyojin Season 2","title_english":"Attack on Titan Season 2","title_japanese":"\u9032\u6483\u306e\u5de8\u4eba Season2","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2017-06-17T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":1,"month":4,"year":2017},"to":{"day":17,"month":6,"year":2017}},"string":"Apr 1, 2017 to Jun 17, 2017"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"R - 17+ (violence & profanity)","score":8.5,"scored_by":1613714,"rank":116,"popularity":12,"members":2344030,"favorites":19910,"synopsis":"For centuries, humanity has been hunted by giant, mysterious predators known as the Titans.
