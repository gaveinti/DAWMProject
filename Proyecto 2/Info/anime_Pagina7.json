In addition, a war between the mafia groups is getting worse. On board the Advena Avis, in 1711, alchemists are about to learn the price of immortality. Based on the award-winning light novels of the same name, Baccano! follows several events that initially seem unrelated, both in time and place, but are part of a much bigger story\u2014one of alchemy, survival, and immortality. Merging these events together are the kindhearted would-be thieves, Isaac and Miria, connecting various people, all of them with their own hidden ambitions and agendas, and creating lifelong bonds and consequences for everyone involved. [Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Baccano! is based on Ryohgo Narita's award-winning light novels of the same title and mainly adapts the first 4 novels. While more faithful to the first 3 novels, the 4th novel (1932) is followed more loosely and is mostly an anime-exclusive story. In addition, content from later novels is briefly included in the anime as well. Unlike the novels however, which follow a mostly linear narrative per book, the anime adopts a non-linear storytelling style; the tale of each novel is told simultaneously with one another, with the focus jumping back and forth in time between and within the different plotlines.","season":"summer","year":2007,"broadcast":{"day":"Fridays","time":"00:30","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Fridays at 00:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/17\/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":765,"type":"anime","name":"Sakura Create","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/765\/Sakura_Create"},{"mal_id":787,"type":"anime","name":"Happinet Pictures","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/787\/Happinet_Pictures"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/102\/Funimation"},{"mal_id":493,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex of America","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/493\/Aniplex_of_America"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":112,"type":"anime","name":"Brain's Base","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/112\/Brains_Base"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/7\/Mystery"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/37\/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/13\/Historical"},{"mal_id":68,"type":"anime","name":"Organized Crime","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/68\/Organized_Crime"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":5,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/5\/Cowboy_Bebop__Tengoku_no_Tobira","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1439\/93480.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1439\/93480t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1439\/93480l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1439\/93480.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1439\/93480t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1439\/93480l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"hc7IxJ93jtM","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hc7IxJ93jtM","embed_url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/hc7IxJ93jtM?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/hc7IxJ93jtM\/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/hc7IxJ93jtM\/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/hc7IxJ93jtM\/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/hc7IxJ93jtM\/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/hc7IxJ93jtM\/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"title":"Cowboy Bebop: Tengoku no Tobira","title_english":"Cowboy Bebop: The Movie","title_japanese":"\u30ab\u30a6\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4\u30d3\u30d0\u30c3\u30d7 \u5929\u56fd\u306e\u6249","title_synonyms":["Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' on Heaven's Door"],"type":"Movie","source":"Original","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2001-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":1,"month":9,"year":2001},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Sep 1, 2001"},"duration":"1 hr 55 min","rating":"R - 17+ (violence & profanity)","score":8.38,"scored_by":193959,"rank":175,"popularity":568,"members":336578,"favorites":1312,"synopsis":"Another day, another bounty\u2014such is the life of the often unlucky crew of the Bebop.
